  <brief> Structure used to store peripheral devices detected during a scan.</brief>
  <doc>We store the bluetooth address of the device, the number of times that the
device was seen during scanning (occurrences) and the rssi (received signal
strength indication) value of the last received advertisement.
**note** the bluetooth address is stored in little-endian (LSB-first) so when
displaying it to the user we need to start at the back of the array
**note** struct has to be packed in order to avoid word alignment.
